- Node works making own server
- Because, NodeJS is back-end (server-side) program
-Servers:
    - Localhost (on local computer)
    - Virtual Host (on local computer)
    - Classic Servers (to go live)
    - Cloud Servers (to go live)

    Additionally:
    - VPS (Virtual Private Server) (to go live)
    -Dedicated server

- To work effeviently with easy coding:
    NodeJS has framework called ExpressJS

-To make webpages, we require standard engine like: HTML. NodeJS has "Template Engine" called EJS.

-Every program leads with entry point like: index.html of HTML, and index.php of PHP program. we can provide custom entry point to the NodeJS.
By default, it takes index.js as an entry point.

    - to use '.env' file to configure environment variables
        nodejs package: dotenv
